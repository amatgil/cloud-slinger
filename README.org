* Cloud Slinger
** Types of Baskets
- Cloud: Always on screen, moving sinusoidally
- Pelican: Moves horizontally, straight across, leaving the screen
- Hot-Air Balloon: Moves diagonally, in the same manner as the pelican
- Baby Bird: Flappy bird style, hops across the screen, bounces off of the edges of the screen N times, and on the N+1, leaves.

** Obstacles
- The Sun: Randomly shoots lasers randomly (in any direction, from [0-..tau/4]). Lasers delete balls.
- Asteriods: Every so often, a huge asteroid starts falling from the sky. Shoot balls at it to make it shrink in size. If, when it lands, it's too big, you go boom-boom and dead-dead. It also breaks baskets in its path. If it's small enough, however, it cna score in said baskets.
  A dinosaur will run around before the asteroid appears, as a warning. It will be in visible distress.
